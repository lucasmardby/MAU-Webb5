      Inline styling is where instead of writing your CSS in a separate file,
      you write in inside an HTML tag using the style attribute. What this
      results in is a styling which affects only the tag it is written in,
      instead of having a CSS file, which would affect the entire HTML document.
      <br />
      <br />
      Writing a separate CSS file is the most powerful and flexible method for
      many reasons. It is more maintainable, reusable, and scalable than inline
      styling. Writing CSS for one selector will affect that HTML tag across the
      entire web page, where as inline styling only touches a single instance of
      that same tag. This means that you can more easily achieve uniformity with
      a CSS file as well as making changes to it. Instead of having to pick
      through style tags over and over again, you simply need to adjust one line
      of CSS. The reusability of a CSS file is also superior, since you can
      apply the same style sheet to multiple web pages for greater consistency.
      <br /><br />
      Another reason for the usage of a CSS file is the distinction of
      structured information and styling. By separating the CSS from the HTML,
      the markup can be semantic, and therefore convey more information and be
      as clear as possible without being blurred and hard to read with all the
      inline styling in the way. Also, by writing the CSS in the style tags, it
      is possible to misuse elements in HTML through the inline styling.
      Changing the purpose of elements is not advised, as web sites are not
      always seen through human eyes. If for instance a screen reader meant for
      people with impaired sight looked through your website, it might mistake
      parts of it because of the HTML tags used, since it will not take the
      inline styling into account. <br /><br />
      However, while there creating a proper CSS file is the best practice,
      there are places for inline styling as well. Mainly older websites or
      places like HTML email and WordPress where HTML is accessible but a
      separate CSS file is not, inline styling would be useful.
