    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      BRANDON SANDERSON is an American author of high fantasy and science
      fiction, best know for the <em>Mistborn</em> and
      <em>The Stormlight Archives</em> series, as well as finishing Robert
      Jordan's <em>Wheel of Time</em>. He created the Sanderson's Laws of Magic
      and thus famously popularized the fantasy concepts of "Hard magic" and
      "Soft magic".<br />
      <br />

      He was born in 1975 in Nebraska, USA, and was an avid reader and writer of
      fantasy authors such as Robert Jordan, Anne McCaffrey, and Orson Scott
      Card, all through junior high and high school. In 1994 Sanderson enrolled
      as a biochemistry major at Brigham Young University, but after a two-year
      leave of absense, returned to his studies instead as an English major.
      While studying full-time during the day, Brandon worked nights as a desk
      clerk to pay for his schooling, and wrote as much as he could during the
      dead shifts. It was in 2003, after finishing thirteen novels, seven of
      which during his undergraduate years alone, and accumulating a substantial
      pile of rejection letters, that he got his first call from an editor. They
      were asking for one of his earlier books, the manuscript of which he had
      submitted a year and a half before. But in 2005, the first of his fantasy
      novels, <em>Elantris</em>, was published.<br />
      <br />

      To touch on style, Brandon Sanderson is famous for his his rich, deeply
      though out fictional settings and clever systems of magic. While not known
      for flowery prose, as Sanderson keeps his writing rather cut-down and
      to-the-point, readers can always expect great worldbuilding and problems
      solved in innovative ways through the magic he builds.
    </p>

    <!--Cosmere-->
    <h2 id="Cosmere">The Cosmere</h2>
    <p>
      THE COSMERE is the fictional universe many of Sanderson's fantasy novels
      take place in. While the stories take place in different settings,
      different planets, all these Cosmere books share the same myth of creation
      and cosmology, which gives ground for the underlying systems of magic in
      these connected worlds. Of course, you can enjoy all of these books and
      series on their own, but since all the worlds in the Cosmere are
      connected, that means that characters, magic, and other ideas from one
      series might show up in another. If you're astute, you may catch one of
      these <em>Worldhoppers</em> as a reward now and then. <br />
      <br />
      The idea of the Cosmere came to Sanderson when he had the idea to create
      an epic-length series that wouldn't demand readers to buy a ridiculous
      amounts of books. Because of this, he has created a 'secret epic' by
      hiding connections to his other works and series within each novel.
      <br />
      <br />
      The cosmology begins with a mysterious being known as
      <em>Adolnalsium</em>, who was killed by a group of conspirators, causing
      its magical power to shatter into sixteen different Shards. Sixteen of
      those conspirators, hence referred to as Vessels, took these Shards and
      travelled to new worlds to add or extend their systems of magic. Each
      Shard has an Intent, such as <em>Honor</em> or <em>Ambition</em>, and a
      Vessels personality is changed in alignment with this intent. A man known
      as Hoid, or sometimes Wit, is seen or mentioned in a large amount of the
      Cosmere books. He is a Worldhopper, and travelles between these
      Shardworlds, to further a so-far unknown agenda. <br />
      <br />
    </p>

    <!--Hard and Soft Magic-->
    <h2 id="Magic">Hard and Soft Magic</h2>
    <p>
      AS MENTIONED ABOVE, Sanderson introduced and popularized the concepts of
      <strong>Hard and Soft Magic</strong> with his works of fantasy and
      science-fiction. Lending itself well to Sanderson's worldbuilding and
      magicsystems in these fictional settings, these are two terms
      characterizing the ends of a spectrum of magic. <br />&emsp;<strong
        >Hard Magic</strong
      >
      follows a specific set of rules, thought out by the author in advance. It
      is controlled and well-explained to the reader, has clear costs and
      consequences to it, in order to be used in the narrative or setting to
      solve problems in a thoughtful and satisfying way.
      <strong>Soft Magic</strong>, on the contrary, do not explain the costs or
      consequences to the reader, and do not follow any rules that the author or
      reader can understand. Instead, it aims to create mystery and a sense of
      wonder surrounding the magic.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Sanderson's Laws of Magic</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        An author's ability to solve conflict with magic in a satisfying way
        is<br />directly proportionate to how well the reader understands said
        magic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Weaknesses, limitations, and costs are more interesting than powers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before an author adds something to their magic, they should see if
        they<br />can instead expand what they have.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      These laws for creating fictional worlds and magic systems are then meant
      to be tools or guide lines for writers and authors depending on where on
      the spectrum of <strong>Hard</strong> or <strong>Soft</strong> magic, the
      sliding scale of 'Problem solving with magic' and 'Sense of wonder', they
      want to be.

    <!--The Secret Project Kickstarter-->
    <h2 id="Secret">The 'Secret Project' Kickstarter</h2>
    <p>
      A MOMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE was in March of 2022 when Sanderson announced
      that he had been writing four additional novels in secret during the
      pandemic. Due to the lack of trips and book tours during the years of
      lockdown, Brandon used that newfound time to write beyond his regular
      schedule of books to finish and publish. This meant that he announced in
      March of 2022 that he was coming out with four secret projects, three of
      which were Cosmere novels, and a fifth children's story which has yet to
      release. <br />
      <br />
      The means by which these were distributed was through the fundraiser
      service <em>Kickstarter</em>, where readers and fans could pledge to make
      these secret projects a reality. People could back the Kickstarter
      campaign to receive their contents the following year, 2023, dubbed
      <strong>The Year of Sanderson</strong>, as a sort of subscription box.
      With a number of tiers to choose from, the campaign had variying rewards
      at different price points. You could pledge to receive these four secret
      project novels quarterly, once every three months, in audio, e-book, or
      premium hardcover format, or go for the Year of Sanderson and receive all
      of this, plus an additional box every month of the year of 2023. <br />
      <br />
      While Sanderson and his team at Dragonsteel had humble expectations for
      the Kickstarter, the fans blew them out of the water when pledges reached
      over 41 million US dollars, after over 185 000 backers chimed in for the
      books, resulting in this becoming the most successful Kickstarter campaign
      of all time. This has significance for the publishing industry, henceforth
      been dominated by the large traditional publishing companies, as well as
      Amazon with Audible in the world of audio books. With Sanderson's
      unbelivable Kickstarter campaign, a shift in the industry occured. A
      great, positve shift where authors no longer need to feel reliant on these
      powerhouse publishers, but instead have the knowledge and ability to
      self-publish through similar means to Sanderson.
