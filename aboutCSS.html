    <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
    <p>
      CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet used for the presentation
      and styling of documents written in languages such as HTML. Without it,
      pure HTML websites would be simple and dry, but with the introduction of
      CSS, we can add colour and style to our documents. It enables the
      separation of the contents and the design of documents, in a separate .css
      file, and therefore a greater control over the properties of style for
      your website. This design choice for separation of content and
      presentation, again like layout, colour, and fonts, improves the
      accessibility and control of our content. This for instance allows for
      multiple HTML pages to share the same visual design through one .css file,
      and can reduces repetition and complexity in the files by separating the
      HTML structural content from the style sheet. Separating the style sheet
      from the content also makes it possible to present said content through
      different lenses of formatting, such as on a screen or on mobile, by voice
      via speech-based browser or screen reader, or on a Braille-based tactile
      device. This naturally smoothens the creative process since the content
      only needs to be written once, while a large number of people of varying
      needs can be met through the different rendering methods and style sheets.

    <h3>Why does CSS exist? How do we use CSS?</h3>
    <p>
      HTML was initially created for scientific reports and programme
      documentation, where the visuals were in low priority. When the web later
      became applicable in other areas as well, the styling and design of your
      websites became more and more appealing. After struggling with designing
      layout in HTML, stylesheets, where CSS is the most popular, was created to
      make this endeavour easier. We use CSS in tandem with HTML, by using the
      link-tag to connect a style sheet in an .css file. It is within this .css
      file that we write our CSS syntax. This consists of selectors, which
      specify which HTML-element to style, and within a scope, properties and
      values. The properties are which part of said element that you want to
      influence, say the colour or the width or something, where the value would
      be what you input into that property, like red or 200 pixels wide.

    <h1>There are multiple versions of CSS:</h1>
    <h3>What versions are there?</h3>
    <p>
      To speak of versions, CSS 1 became the first official W3C Recommendation
      of CSS in 1996. While it is no longer maintain as a Recommendation, within
      its capabilities are properties for font, colour of text, backgrounds, and
      other elements, attributes for spacing of text, for alignment of text,
      images and the like, and other positional properties like margin, border,
      and padding. Many of these properties we can still recognize from the
      versions of CSS we use to this day. Just a few years later came CSS 2 in
      1998, and added a select amount of new properties and features, and has
      since been updated into CSS 2.1. This sought out to fix errors of CSS 2,
      and was finalised in 2011. CSS 3, the latest version, and is still being
      defined module by module, adding and extending features of CSS 2. Since
      this type of module work, pushing forward features into the next
      version—the next level—certain features have already reached CSS 4 or even
      5. While there is no specification for CSS4 that has been integrated, it
      has instead been separated into multiple modules working independently.
      CSS 3 is still the latest version we work with.
    </p>
    <h3>Why are there multiple versions?</h3>
    <p>
      The reason for versioning is that as the web progressed and evolved, older
      versions of CSS became lacking in their features and applicability. With
      the way CSS 1 is built, there are great limitations is what you can
      accomplish, which would not be able to be solved by simply adding to that
      old version. Instead, you add features by creating a new version,
      expanding your toolbox of options and abilities. CSS 3 upgraded its
      specification by going from the previous single document format to being
      divided into individual modules, and expanded the styling options from a
      simple and limited repertoire to a large amount of available options along
      with support for animators. As browsers have evolved, so did CSS have to
      as well. CSS 3 has now complete support for nearly all recent web
      browsers, while earlier versions again were limited in what they could
      accomplish.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Why is is important to know which version a CSS-property belongs to?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Since you do not define the version in your .css file, you need to be
      aware of which properties belong to which version. Since features and
      properties have been added, removed, and changed throughout the versions
      of CSS, using a property incorrectly will create problems in the finished
      product.
